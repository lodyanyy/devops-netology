# Домашняя работа к занятию "7.2. Облачные провайдеры и синтаксис Terraform."

## Задача 1 (Вариант с Yandex.Cloud). Регистрация в ЯО и знакомство с основами.

 Регистрацию и первичное знакомство было в домашней работе 5.4 docker compose

## Задача 2. Создание yandex_compute_instance через терраформ. Решение

1. В каталоге `terraform`  создадим файл `main.tf` и `versions.tf`.

Выполним terraform plan:

```
lodyanyy@lodyanyy:~/netology/07-terraform-02-syntax/cloud-terraform$ terraform plan    

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
